# FAULTY-CALCULATOR

ðŸ§  A simple JavaScript script that generates random business names.


#How it works:

 - Enter two numbers and choose an operator (+, -, *, /).
 - Most of the time, youâ€™ll get the correct result.
 - Occasionally, youâ€™ll get a deliberately incorrect answer!

#NOTE
This is a basic version written purely in JavaScript without any UI. I plan to add an HTML/CSS interface soon as I improve my frontend skills.
